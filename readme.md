## Status Bar

The status bar shows:
- Filename and modification status
- Current line/total lines and column position

- `[Truncated]` indicator for large files

Example: `test.md [Modified] | Ln 15/42, Col 8 | Words: 127`

## Design Philosophy

mkmd embraces the Unix philosophy of doing one thing well. It's designed for:

- **Writers** who want distraction-free markdown editing
- **Developers** who need quick note-taking and documentation
- **Anyone** who prefers keyboard-driven workflows

The editor maintains the simplicity of classic terminal editors while adding modern conveniences that enhance the writing flow without adding complexity.

## Large File Handling

For files exceeding 10,000 lines, mkmd loads content in chunks to maintain responsiveness. Use `Ctrl+T` to navigate to the next chunk and `Ctrl+B` to go back to the previous chunk. If you have unsaved changes, you'll be prompted to save before navigation. The status bar shows navigation hints and indicates when a file is chunked.

**Note:** Chunks use fixed 10K line boundaries. Large edits may cause content to "spill" into adjacent chunks when navigating.

## Dependencies
